Manufacturing Planning System

This is an open source system to enable manufacturers to plan and design processes and assembly lines to more efficiently create products.

This system takes an unstructured Engineering Bill of Materials (eBOM) for an Assembly (ASSY) as a CSV and will enable the user to restructure it into a structure Manufacturing Bill of Materials (mBOM). These can be linked to your CAD files. 

From there, the user can plan out the processes to transform raw materials or components into subassemblies through use of the Process Flow Chart (PFC), and write out Work Instructions (WI) for each process. These can then be compiled to create a Work Order (WO) for each assembly.

The processes can then be grouped manually or automatically into into Work Stations (WS) where multiple processes take place. If processes are given cycle times, the Work Stations can line balance to better optimize work flow.

Takt time for Assemblies can be calculated using a handy calculator.
